# PhoneBuzz

I am hosting this application on Heroku. I am using my own Twilio credentials, please let me know if you would like access to change my Heroku config vars to use your own credentials. Thank you!

## Phase 1 - Complete

* Make sure to configure your Twilio number and point it to http://aqueous-wave-1146.herokuapp.com/
* The request type be must be `POST`
* Call my Twilio number to play PhoneBuzz (201-430-7826)

## Phase 2 - Complete

* Go to this application's http://aqueous-wave-1146.herokuapp.com/ on your browser
* Enter your personal phone number and press submit to play PhoneBuzz

## Phase 3 - Complete

* Go to this application's http://aqueous-wave-1146.herokuapp.com/ on your browser
* Enter your personal phone number
* Enter pause time (default is to make call immediately) and press submit to play

## Phase 4 - Complete

* Same steps as Phase 3. Go to http://aqueous-wave-1146.herokuapp.com/
* Now you can press the replay button on populated list of past calls
* Note: I do not store phone calls that the user makes to the Twilio number, because you can't dial from a personal phone number to a Twilio number. I initially stored both types of calls and played FizzBuzz back to the personal phone number from the Twilio number, but after reading the directions again, it seemed like that was not the intention as the focus had shifted away from making calls to the Twilio number in favor of using the homepage interface after Phase 1.
